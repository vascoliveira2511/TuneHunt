4. **Game Start Logic**:
   - Implemented flexible start conditions (host can start with ‚â•1 players ready)
   - Added dual UI paths for playlist vs individual selection games
   - Fixed missing "Start Game" button visibility

### üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture

#### Database Schema (Prisma)
Key entities:
- `User` - Authentication and profile data
- `Room` - Game rooms with host, settings, max players
- `Game` - Individual game instances within rooms
- `GameParticipant` - Player participation in games
- `Song` - Track metadata from Deezer
- `SelectedSong` - Player song selections for games
- `Playlist` - Curated song collections

#### API Endpoints
- `/api/rooms` - Room CRUD operations
- `/api/rooms/[code]` - Individual room management
- `/api/rooms/[code]/join` - Join room functionality
- `/api/rooms/[code]/new-game` - Create new game after completion
- `/api/games/[gameId]/start` - Game initialization
- `/api/games/[gameId]/start-round` - **NEW**: Server-side round timing control
- `/api/games/[gameId]/next` - Advance to next song (enhanced with playlist support)
- `/api/games/[gameId]/guess` - Submit player guesses
- `/api/games/[gameId]/guesses` - Real-time guess polling (deprecated in favor of state)
- `/api/games/[gameId]/songs` - Get game song summary
- `/api/games/[gameId]/state` - **ENHANCED**: Complete game state with server timing
- `/api/spotify/search` - Track search (now uses Deezer)
- `/api/spotify/track/[id]` - Get track details (now uses Deezer)

#### Key Components
- `app/rooms/page.tsx` - Room browser with premium loading states and card animations
- `app/room/[code]/page.tsx` - Individual room interface with game flow
- `app/create-room/page.tsx` - Room creation wizard
- `components/Game/TrackSelection.tsx` - Song selection interface
- `components/Game/MusicSearch.tsx` - Deezer search with skeleton loading
- `components/Game/GamePlay.tsx` - **ENHANCED**: Server-synced gameplay with perfect timing
- `components/Game/GameSongsSummary.tsx` - Post-game song list summary
- `components/Room/CreateRoomModal.tsx` - Unified room creation modal
- `components/ui/loading.tsx` - **NEW**: Premium loading components (waveform, spinners)

## Development Guidelines

### Before Deployment Checklist
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Always run these commands before deployment:
```bash
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Code Quality Standards
- No ESLint warnings/errors allowed
- Strict TypeScript compilation required
- Proper type assertions instead of `any` usage
- Remove unused imports and variables

### Real-time Updates Pattern
Current implementation uses optimized polling intervals:
- **Game state during gameplay**: 1 second intervals (perfect sync)
- **Room lists**: 10 second intervals
- **Individual rooms (lobby)**: 5 second intervals
- Consider WebSocket upgrade for even better performance

## Game Flow Logic

### Individual Selection Mode
1. Host creates room ‚Üí Status: SELECTING
2. Players join and select individual tracks
3. Host can start game when ‚â•1 player has selected
4. Game transitions to PLAYING status
5. **Host clicks "Start Round"** ‚Üí Server begins timing
6. All players see synchronized timer and audio
7. Players guess tracks with unlimited attempts
8. Host advances to next song when ready

### Playlist Mode
1. Host creates room with playlist ‚Üí Status: SELECTING
2. Players join (no individual selection needed)
3. Host starts game immediately
4. **Host clicks "Start Round"** ‚Üí Server begins timing
5. Game uses playlist tracks in sequence with perfect sync

## Known Issues & Future Improvements

### üêõ Known Issues
- No real WebSocket implementation (using optimized 1s polling for gameplay)
- No offline/reconnection handling
- Limited error handling for Deezer API failures
- No mobile-specific optimizations yet
- ~~Multiplayer synchronization issues~~ **‚úÖ FIXED**

### üöÄ Planned Features
- Real-time WebSocket implementation to replace polling
- Enhanced scoring system with streaks and bonuses
- Game replay functionality and detailed statistics
- Mobile-responsive improvements and PWA features
- Advanced playlist management with categories
- Tournament/bracket modes for competitive play
- Social features (friends, leaderboards, sharing)
- Audio visualization during playback

### üéØ Immediate Next Steps
1. **WebSocket Integration**: Replace polling with real-time updates (lower priority after sync fixes)
2. **Error Handling**: Improve Deezer API error handling
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhance mobile user experience
4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive test coverage
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Track sync accuracy and polling performance

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="..."
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
# Spotify credentials no longer needed - using Deezer API
# SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="..."
# SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
```

### Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # ESLint check
npx tsc --noEmit     # TypeScript check
npx prisma studio    # Database GUI
npx prisma generate  # Update Prisma client
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures
1. Run `npm run lint` - fix all ESLint errors
2. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` - fix TypeScript errors
3. Check for unused imports/variables
4. Verify proper type assertions (avoid `any`)

### Room Issues
- If rooms appear empty: Check participant creation in `/api/rooms`
- If status stuck: Verify game flow logic in room components
- If no real-time updates: Check polling intervals

### Game Synchronization Issues (NOW RESOLVED)
- ~~Players seeing different timers~~ **‚úÖ FIXED** - Server-side timing
- ~~Getting stuck on result screens~~ **‚úÖ FIXED** - 1s polling with state transitions
- ~~Audio not syncing~~ **‚úÖ FIXED** - Automatic audio start on round begin
- ~~Host progression not syncing~~ **‚úÖ FIXED** - Real-time state polling

### Game Start Issues
- Verify host permissions in game start logic
- Check minimum participant requirements
- Ensure proper game mode detection (playlist vs individual)
- Ensure host clicks "Start Round" button to begin timing
